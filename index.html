                <h3>Hello - Adele</h3>
                <p>
                    Hello, it's me<br>
                    I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet<br>
                    To go over everything<br>
                    They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing<br>
                    <br>
                    Hello, can you hear me?<br>
                    I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be<br>
                    When we were younger and free<br>
                    I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet<br>
                    <br>
                    There's such a difference between us<br>
                    And a million miles<br>
                    <br>
                    Hello from the other side<br>
                    I must've called a thousand times<br>
                    To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart<br>
                    But it doesn't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore<br>
                    <br>
                    Hello, how are you?<br>
                    It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry<br>
                    I hope you're well<br>
                    Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?<br>
                    <br>
                    It's no secret that the both of us are running out of time<br>
                    <br>
                    So hello from the other side<br>
                    I must've called a thousand times<br>
                    To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart<br>
                    But it doesn't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore<br>
                    <br>
                    Ooooohh, anymore<br>
                    Ooooohh, anymore<br>
                    Ooooohh, anymore<br>
                    <br>
                    Hello from the other side<br>
                    I must've called a thousand times<br>
                    To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart<br>
                    But it doesn't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
